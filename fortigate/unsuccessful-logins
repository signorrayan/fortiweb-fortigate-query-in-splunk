  This query detects unsuccessful attempts greater than 5 times within the hour by Username.
  It needs a CSV output from those usernames which has Successful logins in the last 30 days (or as you wish depends on your organisation policy) to check the user authorization.
  you can run the following query to list the usernames and then export that in the csv format with the output file name: userlist

  index=fortigate sourcetype=fgt_event earliest=-30d user!="N/A" user!="unknown" logdesc="Authentication logon" | stats count by user | fields - count

  then you should create a lookup table in Lookups section in your Splunk. (you can search or if you stuck in that, please create an issue.)
  After that, you can use the following query to list them.
